## Project: Cloned Site & Integrated Keylogger

This project is a Python/Flask web application designed to clone the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images of a target website and inject data capture functionalities, specifically a keylogger and a login form phishing mechanism.

The application acts as a social engineering tool (for educational and security testing purposes only) by presenting the user with an exact copy of the desired webpage, while capturing both keystrokes and submitted login credentials.
